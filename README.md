# Service 3.2.2 for Rio Vena Digital Twin - District Network Production Economic Optimization
## Introduction
This repo contains all the necessary modules enabling the possibilty to optmize the costs of a Network
The service consists of two main modules:
    * - The Artificial Neural Network Machine Learning Model: this allows the possibility to predict the future consumptions of the Buildings
    * - The Optimizer: given a trained model, the optimizer tries to find the best possible solution in order to manage the consumptions of the Buildings
and one support module
    * - utils.py
## ANN Model
## Optmizer
